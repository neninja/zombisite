Whenever an Actor (or group of Actors) ends a Move Action (or Move Step) in a Zone containing a Dragon Bile pool, and after completing or canceling the mandatory Move, draw an Objective from the trap pile. Look at it, and set it back in its pile, face down. The pile is then shuffled.<ul><li>Red: Nothing happens.</li><li>Green: Flip the Dragon Bile token to the other side. A flaming side indicates a bonfire in the Zone: any Actor standing in or crossing this Zone is subject to a Dragon Fire effect. A magic barrier side means that nothing can go through or out of the Zone (lines of sight are blocked). Both effects end at the next End Phase. Reset the token to its Dragon Bile side.</li></ul></li></ul></article></main></body></html>
