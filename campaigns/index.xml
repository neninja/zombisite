Some places in the region have been deserted since the zombies came. Nobody goes there, ever. Most of the time, these places draw too much attention from the necromancers or have become the houses of angry monsters or are heavily barricaded. What keeps ordinary people at bay is terribly appealing to survivors. So it’s time to take a tour of these “places of interest” and see what we can find there: hidden treasures, a good zombicide, both, and tons of fun.</description></item></channel></rss>
