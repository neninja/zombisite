*Alguns lugares na região ficaram desertos desde que os zumbis vieram. Ninguém vai até lá, nunca. na maior parte do tepo estes lugares atraem muita atenção dos necromantes ou se tornaram moradia para monstros furiosos ou estão fortemente barricados. Aquilo que mantèm as pessoas comuns longe é terrivelmente tentador para os sobreviventes. portanto chegou a hora de fazer um tour por estes "lugares de interesse" e ver o que podemos encontrar por lá: tesouros escondidos, um bom zombicídio, ou ambos, e muita diversão. Preparado?*

## Regras da campanha

### De um lugar para outro
Escolha uma Missão para começar. O *Templo do Fogo* é um bom começo, pois uma vitória facilita a próxima Missão!

As Missões podem ser jogadas em qualquer ordem, entretan a mesma Missão não pode ser jogada duas vezes seguidas.

A campanha acaba assim que os jogadores vencerem as cinco diferentes Missões. Lugares de Interesse é uma campanha nível expert. Você enfrentará um desafio real e horas de diversão cooperativa. Será você um dos pooucos felizardos à visitar todos os locais descritos na campanha e sobreviver?

> *Lugares de Interesse* é uma campanha de 5 Missões criada para o Kickstarter do *Zombicide: Black Plague* em 2015. Foi desenhada incluindo todos os extras da campanha, portanto é recomendado possuir Zumbis extras (incluindo Abominações extras).

### Recompensas da missão
Cada missão dá direito a recompensas especiais na forma de bônus para serem usados uma única vez. A Missão descreve seu efeito no jogo. O sobrevivente pode guardar estes bônus de uma Missão para outra até o fim da campanha, porém uma vez utilizado, ele é consumido. Estes bônus podem ser ganhados de volta ao jogar novamente a Missão relacionada.

### Recompensa vermelha
Qualquer sobrevivente que alcançar o Nível Vermelho ao fim de uma Missão terminada com sucesso pode começar a próxima com uma arma de Cripta da escolha do jogador. Se não houver mais armas de Cripta para todos os Sobreviventes, os jogadores podem escolher distribuir Armas de Cripta entre os Sobreviventes.

> Mas e se...
> - Um Sobrevivente morreu? Sobreviventes são difíceis de matar. O sobrevivente começa a próxima Missão com um Ferimento.
> - Um Sobrevivente foi ferito ao final de uma Missão? É apenas um ferimento superficial. O Sobrevivente é completamente curado.

## Missões

### Quest 1: The temple of fire
- Medium
- 4 sobreviventes
- 180 minutos

*A fire god was worshipped in this remote village. I remember rumors saying that its priests could breathe fire. I didn’t meet any, and it’s too bad; that could have been very useful. Against an Abomination, for example.*

*Unfortunately, the temple is closed and locked. Let’s find the key and cleanse this place—I know a ritual. We don’t want to meet any fire breathing zombies, do we?*

> Tiles needed: 1V, 3V, 4R, 6V, 8R & 9V.

#### Objectives
1. Enter the temple and purify it. You’ll need to find either the blue or green key to enter. The temple is purified as soon as there are no Zombies in the whole building containing the fire token.
2. Perform the ritual. Go through the Zone containing the
fire token until you receive the Fire Blessing (see Special Rules).
3. Escape. Reach the Exit Zone with all starting Survivors. Any Survivor may escape through this Zone at the end of his Activation, as long as there are no Zombies in it. 

#### Special Rules
- Setting. Put the blue and green Objectives randomly among the red Objectives, face down.
- Survivor trinkets. Each Objective gives 5 experience points to the Survivor who takes it.
- Closed and locked. The blue door cannot be opened until the blue Objective has been taken. The green door cannot be opened until the green Objective has been taken.
- The fire god is angry. Any Actor starting his Activation in the fire token Zone triggers a Dragon Fire effect in the Zone. Zom- bies eliminated this way don’t grant any experience points.
- The Fire Blessing. After the temple has been purified, roll a die each time a Survivor goes through the fire token’s Zone. On an even result, nothing happens. On an odd result, the Survivor receives the Fire Blessing as a single-use bonus. A Survivor can’t have more than one Fire Blessing at a time. The Survivor may spend an Action to use it: it creates a Dragon Fire effect at Range 0-1 and within Line of Sight of the Survivor. In addition, this Dragon Fire
effect doesn’t affect its creator!

### Quest 2: Skulls & bones tavern
- Very hard
- 4+ sobreviventes
- 180 minutos

*Just the name of this place is enough to pay a visit. If it wasn’t a necromancer’s lair before the zombies, it is now. We scouted the area and found that a ritual is being performed. It can’t be good. We must stop this.*

> Tiles needed: 4V, 5V, 6R, 7R, 8R & 9R.

![mapa](./places-of-interest-quest2.png)

#### Objectives
1. Enter the Skulls & Bones tavern and end both rituals.
2. Escape. Reach the Exit Zone with all starting Survivors. Any Survivor may escape through this Zone at the end of his Activation, as long as there are no Zombies in it.

#### Special Rules
- Setting.
    - Put the green Objective randomly among the red Objectives, face down.
    - Set apart all the Spawn Cards for at least 3 extra Abominations (Abominalpha, Abominarat, etc.). These cards constitute the Abomination deck. The Spawn Cards for standard Abominations stay in the Zombie deck.
- Unexpected and welcome. Each Objective gives 5 experience points to the Survivor who takes it.
- Necromancer’s reinforcements. The blue Spawn Zone is inactive until the blue door is opened. The blue door can be opened like a standard door. It also opens by itself the first time a Necromancer spawns on the board.
- Closed backdoor. The green door cannot be opened until the green Objective has been taken.
- It’s not a ritual, it’s a TRAP! When a Survivor enters a magic barrier Zone, remove the token and draw a card from the Abomination deck. Spawn the corresponding Zombies in the disrupting Survivor’s Zone.
- Rewards! Survivors who exit the place without any Wounds receive a single-use bonus: Instant Regeneration. A Survivor may use it anytime during his Activation (but not during an Action’s resolution) to fully heal all his Wounds.

### Quest 3: All along the belfry
- Very hard
- 4 sobreviventez
- 180 minutos

*It is sometimes hard to tell when a spectacular action is heroic, stupid, or both. That’s the case here: someone, somehow, managed to trap several Abominations in the town’s belfry. We’ve already heard about single Abominations trapped in a closed place, but several? This is unbelievable.*

*It’s also unfortunate, as necromancers keep coming with their hordes to free these beasts. This is getting old, and we need to stop it.*

*So today, we zombicide everything. Just don’t think too much about the Abominations. Hey, I think I just found the way to be a hero!*

> Tiles needed: 1R, 2R, 3V, 4V, 6R & 7V

#### Objectives
Kill the Abominations. You win the game as soon as the Abomination deck is exhausted (see Special Rules) and there is no Abomination on the board.

#### Special Rules
- Setting.
    - Put the blue Objective randomly among the red Objectives, face down.
    - Set apart all the Spawn Cards for at least 3 extra Abominations (Abominalpha, Abominarat, etc.). These cards constitute the Abomination deck. The Spawn Cards for standard Abominations stay in the Zombie deck.
- It looks funny! Each Objective gives 5 experience points to the Survivor who takes it.
- Command word for the magic barrier ritual. DO NOT READ IT OUT… Too late. When the blue Objective has been taken, the magic barrier Zone starts spawning Abominations. Use it like a regular Spawn Zone, but draw from the Abomination deck instead. This deck is not reshuffled when exhausted.
- Rewards! Survivors who killed an Abomination receive a single-use bonus at the end of the Quest: Ironclad Charm. A Survivor may use it at anytime (but not during an Action’s resolution) to get the Ironclad Skill until the next Ending Phase

### Quest 4: Fortress
- Hard
- 4+ sobreviventes
- 180 minutos

*We spotted this fortress from miles away. Its great entrance is barricaded, and someone managed to pin a warning on the wooden door: “Enter and die”. Charming.*

*Who closed this place? What’s inside? Are we curious and stupid enough to get in and find out by ourselves? I know the answer to that one: yes, we are.*

*A constant humming and sulfur stench, you say? Don’t worry so much. Everything will be okay, I’m sure.*

> Tiles needed: 2V, 5V, 8V & 9R.

![mapa](./places-of-interest-quest4.png)

#### Objectives
Kill what lies behind the magic barriers. You win as soon as both magical barriers are gone and there are no Zombies in the Street Zones.

#### Special Rules
- Fountains of Death. During the Spawn Step, don’t look at the Zombie cards drawn for the Spawn Zones located within the magic barriers. Store them under their respective magic barrier instead.
- The humming stopped! When a Survivor opens a violet Vault door:
    - Remove the magic barrier token in the street leading to the violet Vault door.
    - Reveal the Spawn Cards stacked on the Spawn Zone, one after the other, and set the corresponding Zombies. Double Spawn cards apply to this Spawn Zone.
- Necromancers passing by. Necromancers are familiar with the fortress and can use the Vaults doors. Any Necromancer activating in a Zone holding a Vault door spends its Action to open it, ignoring any Survivors standing in the same Zone.
- Missing keys. Standard doors cannot be opened. The blue door and the Vault’s doors can be opened like standard doors.
- It’s a crypt! Both Vaults are connected by an open door.
- Rewards! Any Survivor who opened a Vault door in a Street Zone receives a magic barrier token at the end of the Quest. This is a single-use bonus: the Survivor can spend it anytime (but not during an Action’s resolution) to place the magic barrier token on a Spawn Zone within Line Of Sight. Any Zombie card drawn for the trapped Spawn Zone is put under the token instead, face down and without revealing it. As soon as the card amount reaches two, interrupt the Spawn Step. Reveal the hidden Zombie cards one by one, spawning the corresponding Zombies for each of them. Double Spawn cards apply to the current Spawn Zone only. Then, resume the Spawn Step.

### Quest 5: The dark anchor
- Very Hard
- 4+ sobreviventes
- 180 minutos

*Necromancers seem to use this place to hold their most terrific undead minions: Abominations. They are standing there, waiting for their master. With some kind of dark magic, necromancers make these monsters stand still. They don’t move even if they sense us in the vicinity. It could be a great occasion to deal a major blow. Anything that can irritate necromancers is worth the effort.*

> Tiles needed: 1R, 3V, 4V, 5R, 8R & 9V.

![mapa](./places-of-interest-quest5.png)

#### Objectives
Kill the Abominations. You win the game as soon as there are no more Abominations on the board.

#### Special Rules
- Setting.
    - Put the blue Objective randomly among the red Objectives, face down.
    - Put 5 Abominations (your choice) in the marked Zones.
- Sealed doors. The blue door cannot be opened until the blue Objective has been taken. The green door cannot be opened until the green Objective has been taken.
- Necromancers have the green key. If a Necromancer activates in front of the green door, it uses its Action to open it, ignoring any Survivors standing in the Zone.
- Stay still! That’s my boy. Abominations don’t move unless either door leading to them is opened.
- Clues to other places. Each Objective gives 5 experience points to the Survivor who takes it.
- Dark Anchor. The blue Spawn Zone activates as soon as a Necromancer is drawn. The blue Spawn zone can’t be moved or removed from the game, and no other Spawn Zone can be placed in its Zone. Necromancers that do NOT spawn on the blue Spawn Zone try to reach the blue Spawn Zone, no matter how far they are from it. They enter through the green door. Necromancers spawning on the blue Spawn Zone act normally.
- Rewards! Survivors who killed an Abomination receive a single-use bonus at the end of the Quest: +1 Damage when performing a Combat Action involving an Abomination. This bonus can be used with any weapon after an attack roll.
