 Some places in the region have been deserted since the zombies came. Nobody goes there, ever. Most of the time, these places draw too much attention from the necromancers or have become the houses of angry monsters or are heavily barricaded. What keeps ordinary people at bay is terribly appealing to survivors.

Ready?</em></p><h2 id=regras-da-campanha>Regras da campanha</h2><h3 id=from-place-to-place>From place to place</h3><p>Chose a Quest to begin with. The Temple of Fire is a good start, as a victory eases the following Quest! Quests are played in any order the players choose. The same Quest can’t be played twice in a row, though. The campaign ends after the players have won all five Quests. Places Of Interest is an expert-level campaign. You will face a real challenge and hours of team-oriented fun. Will you be one of the happy few to boast of having visited all the places depicted in this campaign and survived?</p><blockquote><p>Places Of Interest is a five-Quest campaign created for Zombicide: Black Plague’s 2015 Kickstarter. It was designed with all impending stretch goals, so having extra Zombie miniatures (including extra Abominations) is recommended.</p></blockquote><h3 id=quest-rewards>Quest rewards</h3><p>Each Quest gives special rewards in the form of single-use bonuses. The Quest describes its related game effect. A Survivor can save the use of these bonuses from one Quest to the next until the end of the campaign, but once it’s spent, it’s spent. They can be earned back by replaying their related Quest.</p><h3 id=red-reward>Red reward</h3><p>Any Survivor reaching the Red Level at the end of a successful Quest may begin the next with a Vault weapon of the player’s choice. If there are not enough Vault weapons to equip all eligible Survivors, the players’ team chooses the way the Vault weapons are distributed among Survivors.</p><blockquote><p>What if…</p><ul><li>A Survivor dies? Survivors are hard to kill. The Sur- vivor begins the next quest with a Wound.</li><li>A Survivor is wounded by the end of a Quest? It’s just a flesh wound! The Survivor is fully healed.</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id=missões>Missões</h2><h3 id=quest-1-the-temple-of-fire>Quest 1: The temple of fire</h3><ul><li>Medium</li><li>4 sobreviventes</li><li>180 minutos</li></ul><p><em>A fire god was worshipped in this remote village. I remember rumors saying that its priests could breathe fire. I didn’t meet any, and it’s too bad; that could have been very useful. Against an Abomination, for example.</em></p><p><em>Unfortunately, the temple is closed and locked. Let’s find the key and cleanse this place—I know a ritual. We don’t want to meet any fire breathing zombies, do we?</em></p><blockquote><p>Tiles needed: 1V, 3V, 4R, 6V, 8R & 9V.</p></blockquote><p><img src=./places-of-interest-quest1.png alt=mapa></p><h4 id=objectives>Objectives</h4><ol><li>Enter the temple and purify it. You’ll need to find either the blue or green key to enter. The temple is purified as soon as there are no Zombies in the whole building containing the fire token.</li><li>Perform the ritual. Go through the Zone containing the
fire token until you receive the Fire Blessing (see Special Rules).</li><li>Escape. Reach the Exit Zone with all starting Survivors. Any Survivor may escape through this Zone at the end of his Activation, as long as there are no Zombies in it.</li></ol><h4 id=special-rules>Special Rules</h4><ul><li>Setting.

Each Objective gives 5 experience points to the Survivor who takes it.</li><li>Closed and locked. The blue door cannot be opened until the blue Objective has been taken. The green door cannot be opened until the green Objective has been taken.</li><li>The fire god is angry. Any Actor starting his Activation in the fire token Zone triggers a Dragon Fire effect in the Zone. Zom- bies eliminated this way don’t grant any experience points.</li><li>The Fire Blessing. After the temple has been purified, roll a die each time a Survivor goes through the fire token’s Zone. On an even result, nothing happens. On an odd result, the Survivor receives the Fire Blessing as a single-use bonus. A Survivor can’t have more than one Fire Blessing at a time. The Survivor may spend an Action to use it: it creates a Dragon Fire effect at Range 0-1 and within Line of Sight of the Survivor. In addition, this Dragon Fire
effect doesn’t affect its creator!</li></ul><h3 id=quest-2-skulls--bones-tavern>Quest 2: Skulls & bones tavern</h3><ul><li>Very hard</li><li>4+ sobreviventes</li><li>180 minutos</li></ul><p><em>Just the name of this place is enough to pay a visit.

When a Survivor enters a magic barrier Zone, remove the token and draw a card from the Abomination deck. Spawn the corresponding Zombies in the disrupting Survivor’s Zone.</li><li>Rewards!

This is unbelievable.</em></p><p><em>It’s also unfortunate, as necromancers keep coming with their hordes to free these beasts. This is getting old, and we need to stop it.</em></p><p><em>So today, we zombicide everything. Just don’t think too much about the Abominations.

Any Survivor who opened a Vault door in a Street Zone receives a magic barrier token at the end of the Quest. This is a single-use bonus: the Survivor can spend it anytime (but not during an Action’s resolution) to place the magic barrier token on a Spawn Zone within Line Of Sight. Any Zombie card drawn for the trapped Spawn Zone is put under the token instead, face down and without revealing it. As soon as the card amount reaches two, interrupt the Spawn Step. Reveal the hidden Zombie cards one by one, spawning the corresponding Zombies for each of them. Double Spawn cards apply to the current Spawn Zone only.
